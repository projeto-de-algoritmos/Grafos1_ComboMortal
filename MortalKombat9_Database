II. KOMBATANTS
==============



BARAKA
------

Baraka is the fiercest of the Tarkatans, vicious nomadic mutants from the
wastes of Outworld. Like all Tarkatan males, he joined Shao Kahn's army
once he came of age and survived the brutal Ritual of Blood. He gained
the rank of Enforcer after single-handedly defeating a rebel faction. His
loyalty and strength make him a favorite of the emperor; his retractable
blades have slain many of Shao Kahn's most bitter enemies. As a kontestant
in the Mortal Kombat tournament, he will ensure his emperor's claim to
Earthrealm.

CYRAX
-----
"Safeties disabled.  Combat mode engaged!"

A skilled Motswana warrior, Cyrax relies on his natural fighting ability,
his chi, to carry out Lin Kuei missions. He is proud to serve, but when
the Grand Master initiates a program to convert the clan into cyborgs,
Cyrax resists. He is reluctant to lose his humanity, which he believes
is more effective than any mechanical augmentation. He has contemplated
leaving the clan, fearing that it is no longer an organization of
honorable assassins. Cyrax knows, however, that such a decision means
death at the hands of his former comrades. No one leaves the Lin Kuei.

ERMAC
-----
"We are many; you are but one!"

As punishment for resisting Shao Kahn's claim to the realm of Edenia, the souls
of the vanquished were torn from their bodies and fused together to form the
being now known as Ermac. Bent to Shao Kahn's will, Ermac is his foremost
enforcer. The essences of so many souls bound together give Ermac immense
telekinetic power--an advantage that will destroy Earthrealm's resistance
to Shao Kahn's rule.

JADE
----
"This will be easy!"

An assassin for Shao Kahn, Jade has earned a reputation as an agile and stealthy
warrior. Her family was Edenian nobility and served the emperor once he
conquered their realm, giving Jade to him as tribute when she was a child.
After years of rigorous training in the art of kombat, Shao Kahn awarded her
the position of Bodyguard to Princess Kitana. Over the centuries she and Kitana
have become close friends, which makes Jade's secret orders from Shao Kahn
painful to accept: Should Kitana's loyalty falter, Jade must kill her friend.

JAX
---
"Bring it!"

A decorated member of the U.S. Special Forces and a formidable close-kombat
warrior, Major Jackson Briggs' current mission is to bring down the notorious
criminal organization known as the Black Dragon. With Lieutenant Sonya Blade,
he has seized many of their weapons caches. But when a trusted informant, Kano,
was revealed to be a high-ranking member of the Black Dragon, Jax made Kano's
capture his priority. Kano has gotten the better of Jax thus far, leading the
Special Forces into numerous deadly ambushes. Jax and Sonya finally cornered
Kano on an uncharted island but were overpowered by the island's inhabitants.
They have now been forced into a sadistic ritual of bloody kombat.

JOHNNY CAGE
-----------
"I make this look easy!"

There is no greater martial arts movie star than Johnny Cage. Films such
as "Dragon Fist", "Time Smashers" and "Citizen Cage" have made him one of
the most highly paid actors in Hollywood. But there is more to Johnny than
even he knows. He is a descendant of an ancient Mediterranean cult who bred
warriors for the gods -- warriors who possessed power beyond that of mortals.
This legacy has made Johnny Cage a star. More important, it will aid him in
the battle to come.

KABAL
-----
"Let's see what you're made of!"

Once a member of the Black Dragon clan, Kabal gave up his life of crime and put
his fighting skills to more positive uses. He joined the New York City police
force to kombat the underworld element he once served. This transition helped
ease the pain of dark memories. But when New York was invaded he underwent
another transformation--one that would afflict him physically. Severely injured
in battle, he is doomed to wear a life support system forever.

KANO
----

Undisciplined and dangerous, Kano is a thug for hire. From weapons dealing to
cold-blooded murder, his military training has made him the go-to man for the
Black Dragon. But when an operation went to hell and his face horribly
mutilated, Kano's crime spree was almost ended. Ever the survivor, he used his
underworld connections to find a cyberneticist capable of repairing the damage.
Kano was fitted with several high-tech enhancements, most notably his eye
laser. With these new weapons, Kano's reign of terror has only just begun.

KITANA
------
"You will learn respect!"

Over 10,000 years old, Princess Kitana remembers little of her early
years. Her mother, Queen Sindel, died mysteriously ages ago in Earthrealm.
Most of her life she has loyally served her father, Shao Kahn, in his unending
quest to conquer the realms. With her closest frienDown, Jade, Kitana enforces
his brutal will. But there is a feeling tugging at her... a feeling that the
life she has known is a deception. For the moment, Kitana dutifully works to
ensure Outworld's victory in this latest Mortal Kombat tournament. If she were
to lower her guard, however, she might discover that her Earthrealm opponents
can lead her to answers.

KRATOS
------
(NOTE:  PS3 ONLY)
"You will not see the end of this day!"

Ancient Greece knew no more bloodthirsty a warrior than Kratos, who for a
time was the God of War. Mortal once more, Kratos withdrew from the ages-old
clash between men and gods. But his solitude was broken when he was ripped
through space and time. As the madness subsided, Kratos found himself in
present-day Outworld, kneeling before Shao Kahn. To ensure his victory in
Mortal Kombat, the emperor had invoked an ancient ritual, sacrificing the souls
of his vanguard to summon and enslave the most powerful warrior of all time.
But the spell alone could not contain Kratos, who soon regained his free will.
Enraged by Shao Kahn's arrogance, Kratos vowed to rip the warlord's spine from
his body. The God of War had returned to battle.

KUNG-LAO
--------
"For the Shaolin!"

Kung Lao's ancestor was defeated by Goro 500 years ago in the pivotal match
that saw Shang Tsung attain control of the Mortal Kombat tournament. To him
this contest is about more than Earthrealm's freedom. His life's goal has been
to slay Goro and win the tournament, thus restoring his family's honor. After
being defeated by Liu Kang in a qualifying bout, he disguised himself as one
of Shang Tsung's guards to gain admittance. Kung Lao believes he is ready for
the challenge. The time to avenge his ancestor is at hand.

LIU-KANG
--------
"Show me what you can do!"

Orphaned at a very young age, Liu Kang was raised by Shaolin monks, who taught
him the way of the spiritual warrior. They soon recognized his potential as a
contender for the Mortal Kombat tournament and rigorously trained him for this
task. Raiden, too, understood that Liu Kang was Earthrealm's best hope for
freedom and introduced him to Master Bo' Rai Cho to further his development.
Once fully trained, Liu Kang bested all challengers and earned the high honor
of representing the Shaolin in the Mortal Kombat tournament. He and Raiden then
embarked on their fateful journey to Shang Tsung's island to compete in this
pivotal kontest.

MILEENA
-------
"Let's Dance!"

Shang Tsung has created many abominable creatures in his Flesh Pits, but none
so twisted as Mileena. A fusion of Edenian flesh and Tarkatan blooDown, Mileena
is both beauty and beast. This dichotomy has made her mind unstable; she is
prone to fits of madness and savagery. Though she has the appearance of a
mature woman, she is more child than adult--a blank slate conformed to
Shao Kahn's will. Devoid of conscience or remorse, Mileena will butcher
anyone to appease her beloved father.

Nightwolf is one of few Earthrealm mortals with a strong connection to the

forces and communes with divine beings such as Haokah, known to the East as
Raiden. Nightwolf's devotion allows the Spirits to work through him, granting
him unnatural long life and ethereal weapons to kombat the darkness that
threatens mortalkind. In the coming crisis, however, it is not Nightwolf's
arsenal that will alter fate. His faith in the Spirits will inspire those who
have lost hope.

Earthrealm. A faithful servant and a recent addition to the Brotherhood
of Shadow, he will obey his master, Quan Chi, and complete his mission. But
he is biding his time. Noob Saibot has a dark objective of his own.

QUAN CHI
--------
"You will serve me in the Netherrealm!"

(NOTE: To unlock Quan Chi, complete chapter 16 in Story Mode)

The Netherrealm has produced many vile beings, but none rival the
Arch-Sorcerer Quan Chi. In lieu of Netherrealm demons, he prefers to
resurrect deceased warriors for use in his sinister plans. Foremost
among them is the tortured Shirai Ryu ninja Scorpion, who is Quan Chi's
personal assassin. Quan Chi is building an army of such specters--the
purpose of which has yet to be revealed. Another mystery is the
sorcerer's involvement in the Mortal Kombat tournament. The Netherrealm
has no stake in its outcome, which leads some observers to question
his presence....

RAIDEN
------
"Thunder take you!"

Raiden is the God of Thunder and Protector of Earthrealm. Ageless and
wise beyond measure, he leads Earthrealm's mortals in the endless battle
against the forces of darkness. When Shao Kahn, Emperor of OutworlDown,
threatened to merge his realm with Earthrealm, an overwhelmed Raiden
implored the Elder Gods to give Earthrealm a fighting chance. Thus the
Mortal Kombat tournament was created. For millennia Shao Kahn has been
kept at bay, but nine consecutive losses to Goro have eroded hope that
Earthrealm can be saved. Determined to prevent Armageddon, Raiden tirelessly
quests to find a champion worthy of Mortal Kombat.

REPTILE
-------


His home realm of Zaterra is gone, mysteriously destroyed ages ago.
Reptile is the last known surviving member of his race. He has since
made Outworld his home. Shao Kahn has made use of Reptile's mastery of
stealth to spy on suspected traitors and slay known enemies of the empire.
But the knowledge that he is the last of his kind gnaws at Reptile. He
would give anything, kill anyone, if it would bring his realm back from
the abyss. Self-pity fuels his aggression as he inflicts suffering and
death on others.

SCORPION
--------
"Vengance shall be mine!"

Hanzo Hasashi was once a member of the Japanese Shirai Ryu ninja clan. Given
the name Scorpion for his blindingly fast and deadly fighting skill, his life
was blessed with glorious kombat in the name of his Grand Master. But when he,
his family and his clan were brutally exterminated by Sub-Zero and the
Lin Kuei, Scorpion's existence became eternal torment. Resurrected by the
malevolent necromancer Quan Chi, he entered the Mortal Kombat tournament to
slay Sub-Zero and avenge the murders of his kin.

SEKTOR
------
"I will show no mercy!"

The son of the Grand Master, it was never in question that Sektor would join
the Lin Kuei. What pleases the Grand Master is the degree to which his son
relishes the life of an assassin. The secretive clan allows Sektor to express
his darker nature, using any means necessary to complete his tasks. Hired by
Shang Tsung, his current assignment is to attend the Mortal Kombat tournament
and eliminate the Earthrealm competitors before they have a chance to compete.
Though this mission will put his clan in good standing with Shao Kahn, Sektor's
ultimate goal is to supplant his father as Grand Master of the Lin Kuei.

SHANG TSUNG
-----------
"Your soul is mine!"

A treacherous sorcerer who consumes the souls of his victims, Shang Tsung
has played host to the last nine Mortal Kombat tournaments in Earthrealm,
stacking the odds in favor of his master. Originally from Earthrealm,
Shang Tsung's magical abilities led him to discover the realm of Outworld.
There he fell in league with its ruler, Shao Kahn, and pledged his life
to him in return for enhanced power. He is now bound to the emperor by
powerful dark magic. For centuries he has submissively done Shao Kahn's
bidding. Should he fail in his mission to secure Earthrealm, he will
suffer the emperor's wrath.

Queen Sindel and prevented her capture. She was subsequently appointed
Sindel's personal bodyguard until the queen's mysterious death in
Earthrealm. Sheeva is now the master jailer of Shao Kahn's
oppressive dungeon.

SINDEL
------
"You are pathetic and weak!"

The mother of Kitana, Queen Sindel was forced into marriage with Shao Kahn
when he conquered her realm of Edenia. In an attempt to thwart the emperor's
designs on Earthrealm, she sacrificed herself. Her suicide created a magical
ward preventing him from setting foot there. But now the barrier has been
dissolved. Sindel has been resurrected, her mind enslaved by Shao Kahn.
Earthrealm's former ally has become a deadly threat.

SMOKE
-----
"Where there is smoke, there is fire!"

Originating from Prague, Tomas Vrbada was recruited by the Lin Kuei for
his impressive ability to escape capture. Able to transform into a wisp
of smoke, his talent has proved useful on countless missions. Smoke has
no memory of his childhood. His only family is the Lin Kuei, more
specifically the younger Sub-Zero, who is like a brother to him. It has

and the origin of his power.

SONYA
-----
"I guess I'll have to do this the hard way!"

As a girl, Sonya idolized her father, a U.S. Marine. When he embarked on
a covert operation and never returned , she vowed to honor his memory.
She joined the Marines and pushed herself hard, quickly rising in rank.
Sonya's impulsiveness didn't win her many friends, but her skills and
loyalty gained the respect and admiration of all who fought beside her.
Though she has never given up her quest to uncover the truth behind her
father's disappearance, she realizes that she might never see him again.
Now Sonya finds herself caught up in the mysterious Mortal Kombat
tournament. Like her father, she too could become a casualty of war.

STRYKER
-------
"Police brutality, comin' up!"

One of New York City's Finest, Stryker is a one-man SWAT team. He was
once decorated for single-handedly thwarting the terrorists in the famous
Greenberg Tower Incident, and again for rescuing passengers of a speeding
crosstown bus rigged to explode. He was unprepared, however, for the
magical portal that spewed forth creatures from another realm--a realm
he didn't even know existed. So far his kombat training has gotten him
through the first wave of creatures. It'll take more than rocket-launching
Tarkatans to stop this die-hard cop.

VI. THE CHALLLENGE TOWER
========================

300 different trials to attempt!  As you clear each trial, it unlocks the next
one up the tower.  Is a trial too hard?  You can skip it for the mere cost of
1.5 times the koin reward.  So if the challenge is 100 koins, it costs 150
koins to skip the challenge; a challenge worth 200 koins will cost you 300
koins to skip, 400 costs 600, and so on.

The types of challenges varies:  traditional one-on-one matches, tag-team,
one-on-three, "Test Your.." minigames, slow-motion fights, certain abilities
ehnanced or disabled, even koins for each time you hit your opponent.

Completing certain challenges will unlock addtional features for the
"Test Your..." minigames, and completing all 300 challenges will unlock
Mileena's Flesh Pit costume from Story Mode.
